      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
      1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
      make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
      also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
      unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
      sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br />
      Example for br tag. Use br/ since it is an autoclosing tag.

      >Example for strong tag. Strong is a synonym for bold. we were using it in
      HTML4 since there was no bold tag. Even now some of the editors internally
      call strong when we use bold tag.</strong

    <ul>
      Example for unordered list.<br />
      The items which have to be displayed in bullet points should be sandwiched
      between the ul tags and each specific item should be enclosed within a li
      tag.
      <li>name</li>
      <li>age</li>
      <li>country</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
      Example for unordered list.<br />
      The items which have to be displayed in a numbered list should be
      sandwiched between the ul tags and each specific item should be enclosed
      within a li tag.
      <li>name</li>
      <li>age</li>
      <li>country</li>

      This is an example of relative and absolute links. If an image,gif etc.,
      linked or referenced in the code is in the path where we can choose to
      store and make a reference to it,is a relative link. If we are referencing
      a location which is available in a path which we cannot modify bu just
      use/make a reference to, like from the internet, it is called absolute
      link. Make sure that the link ends with the extension of the file,
      otherwise it will appear broken. Also the img tag is an self closing tag,
      so make sure to end it with a forward slash
    </p>
    <img
      width="350"
      height="315"

      alt="stock image"
    />

      This is an example of linking to an external page. Make sure to use the
      'a' tag which is the anchor tag, used to embed links. When we use just a
      tag and href to create a link to an extenal site, it opens the page in the
      same tab. To open the page in a new tab, use target as _blank<br />
      <a href="https://karthick-git.github.io/online-portfolio/">
        click here to view my portfolio in the same tab</a
      ><br />
      <a
        href="https://karthick-git.github.io/online-portfolio/"
        target="_blank"
      >
        click here to view my portfolio in a different tab</a
      >

      This is an example of linking to an email. Whatever mentioned in the above
      paragraph is applicable here plus add a
      'mailto:insert_the_email_address_here'to create a direct link to open the
      email applciation installed on the system and fill the 'to' address<br />
      <a href="mailto:karthick@abc.com"> click here to email me</a>

      This is an example of playing and controlling audio.This is one of the
      features wich differentiates html4 and 5, this feature helps us play and
      control audio within our page. use the audiotag and specify the source of
      the mp3 or any audio file and then include 'controls' next to the opening
      audio tag, to enable sound controls and play and pause controls. this is
      very important.<br />
      <audio controls>
        <source
          src="https://www.learningcontainer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Kalimba-online-audio-converter.com_-1.wav"
        />
      </audio>

      This is an example of playing and controlling video.This is another
      feature wich differentiates html4 and 5, this feature helps us play and
      control video within our page. use the videotag and specify the source of
      the mp4 file or any video file and then include 'controls' next to the
      opening video tag, to enable sound controls and play and pause controls.
      this is very important.we can add an optional attribute 'autoplay' similar
      to the 'controls' attribute we added for audio. More details at w3 schools

      <video controls>
        <source

      Embedding a video is the preferred way of doing the above operation since
      it takes a lot of load out of our website and helps our website load
      quicker. for eg: if we want to embed a video from youtube into our site,
      go to video--share--embed--uncheck or check the options as required and
      copy the code and paste it in our file, if this is done the video tag is
      not required <br />

      This is an example of iframe. An iframe is nothing but a part of a
      webpage, so if we are trying to display a part of another webpage in out
      page, we can make use of it. already referenced in embedding youtube
      videos

    <h3>contact form</h3>
    <p>
      This is an example of forms. forms are not fully functional unless there
      is a server side program written to store and process the data entered.
      there are two main fields used (input type = "text") is used when there
      requirement is to allow the user to enter a username or password etc. i.e
      anything not more than 2 words. But textarea is used when the user has to
      type long sentences for eg. feedback area or address field etc. we can add
      a radio button, radio button group, single check box or a check box group
      also.
    </p>
    <form>
      <p><input type="text" /></p>
      <p><textarea>Enter your feedback here</textarea></p>
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
