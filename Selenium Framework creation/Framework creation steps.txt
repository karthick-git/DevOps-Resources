Prerequisites
Java is installed on the system
Eclipse is installed on the system
Maven is installed on the system

Create a Maven project in Eclipse
add dependencies in pom.xml
directly copy & paste the dependencies in pom.xml from maven repository -->Selenium java or go to the dependencies tab in pom.xml
and give the groupID, artifactID & version, it will get added in pom.xml
The list of dependencies required for creating a basic selenium java framework
Selenium Java
junit
geckodriver

create a folder inside the project called driver and place the drivers inside that
To add gecko driver exe
System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver",” path to gecko driver exe”);
OR
System.setProperty("webdriver.firefox.marionette", “path to gecko driver exe”);
If we are setting the driver path in environment variables --> path, we don't need to use System.setProperty in the code
after setting the path, open cmd and type ChromeDriver.exe and hit enter, the driver should start running successfully

How to add Chrome Driver
Run a test on Chrome browser
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver",”location of
chromedriver”);
Webdriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

helpful tips
Always check the latest version of chrome driver from https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver

How to add IE Driver
System.setProperty("webdriver.ie.driver",”location of iedriver”);
Webdriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();

helpful tips
Always check the latest version of ie driver from https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver
If IE is throwing protected mode settings are not the same for all zones error, open IE-->Settings-->Security
uncheck Enable protected mode under all 4 icons-->apply & close

Use WebDriver Manager for Automatic management of browser drivers for Selenium
Uses : don't need to download drivers.exes for any browser
WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
WebDriverManager.firefoxdriver().setup();
WebDriverManager.operadriver().setup();
WebDriverManager.phantomjs().setup();
WebDriverManager.edgedriver().setup();
WebDriverManager.iedriver().setup();
References
https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager

Use the below sample code
WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup(); or WebDriverManager.chromedriver().version("").setup();
Webdriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

helpful tips
Check your selected locator in different browsers
Can take help of tools for generating xpath and cssSelectors like chropath plugin or xmltoolbox.appspot.com
Can ask developers to provide unique ids to every web element for easy identification and location

Implement POM

A Design Principle where we Create separate Object Repository to store object locators
For each web page there should be a separate page class
The page class will have all object locators and preferably
action methods for the corresponding page

Step 1 :
Create a class for each web page
Step 2 :
Add object locators
Step 3 :
Create class for test
Step 4 :
Refer objects from page classes
Step 5 :
Run and validate

Benefits of POM
=============
Test Objects and Functions are separated for easy
maintenance and keeping the code clean
Objects are kept separated from test scripts and can be
used multiple times in multiple tests
Every unique object locator is created only once
Easy Maintenance and Less Rework

What is TestNG
TestNG is a testing framework for the Java programming
language created by Cédric Beust and inspired by JUnit
and NUnit.
Makes test creation, execution and reporting efficient
Uses annotations like
@BeforeTest, @AfterTest,
@BeforeSuite, @AfterSuite
@BeforeMethod, @AfterMethos
@BeforeClass, @AfterClass
NG = Next Generation

Install TestNG for selenium
help-->Install new software -->Add "https://dl.bintray.com/testng-team/testng-eclipse-release"
the above URL was taken from https://github.com/cbeust/testng-eclipse/
Select Next and finish

Add TestNG libraries
Configure build path --> add libraries --> testng--> finish
Or add maven dependency for TestNG from mvnrepository.com

Advantages of TestNG
Makes test creation, execution and reporting efficient
Helps in Grouping of tests
Helps in Prioritizing of tests
Parallel execution
Reporting

Creating TestNG.xml file
RC on the project --> TestNG --> Convert to TestNG
Use Include/Exclude methods in TestNg xml to Include and Exclude the methods in a class for running

Uses of TestNG.xml
include tests, class, packages etc
exclude tests, class, package etc
set test dependency
set test priorities
pass parameters to test methods
run in parallel

What is Extent Reports | How to use Extent Reports in
Selenium
What is Extent Report
HTML Reporting library
ExtentReports is an open-source reporting API for Java
and .NET. It creates an interactive HTML report of your
test session.
ExtentReports also has a commercial version (Pro)
How to implement ExtentReports in Selenium Java
Step 1 :
Add ExentReports libraries in project
You can add jars or maven dependency
Step 2 :
Create references of ExtentReport func
Step 3 :
Use ExtentReport functions
log, info, pass, fail etc
Step 4 :
Run and Validate

Maven dependency can be copied from ExtentReports.com
To see an example for implementing ExtentReports, go to documentation --> Java --> Examples

What is DesiredCapabilities
A class in Selenium library org.openqa.selenium.remote.DesiredCapabilities
Describes a series of key/value pairs
Used to set properties for browser like BrowserName, Platform, Version etc

What is Log4j
Log4j is a java based logging framework
Is simple, flexible, reliable and fast
Is configured through a configuration file Log4j.xml OR log4j.properties etc...
Practical Example
Step 1:
Add Log4j libraries in the java project
Can add jar files or maven dependency
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html
Step 2 :
Create reference for Logger in the class
Class where you want to add log statements
Step 3 :
Create log4j.xml or log4j.properties file
Step 4 :
Run and Validate
Log4j - log levels
TRACE
Most detailed information. Expect these to be written to logs only. Since version 1.2.12
DEBUG
Detailed information on the flow through the system.
Expect these to be written to logs only. Generally speaking, most lines logged by your application should be written as DEBUG
INFO
Interesting runtime events (startup/shutdown). Expect these to be immediately visible on a console, so be conservative and keep to a minimum.
WARN
Use of deprecated APIs, poor use of API, 'almost' errors,
other runtime situations that are undesirable or unexpected, but not necessarily "wrong". Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.
ERROR
Other runtime errors or unexpected conditions. Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.
FATAL
Severe errors that cause premature termination. Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.
OFF
The highest possible rank and is intended to turn off logging.
** built-in log levels with increasing order of severity
helpful tips
You can configure to append or overwrite logs in file
You can set logging OFF when not required in case heavy logging is making your runs slower...
Log4j - Configuration File
Log4j is configured through a configuration file
Configuration files can be written in XML, JSON, YAML, or properties file format
Set of key-value pairs. Within a configuration you can define three main components:
Loggers
Appenders
Layouts
Configuring logging via a file has the advantage that logging can be turned on or off without modifying the application that uses Log4j.
Log4j - FAQ
Written in Java | Cross platform
part of the Apache Logging Services
initial release - January 8, 2001
Repository - https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2
Website - https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/
On August 5, 2015 the Apache Logging Services Project
Management Committee announced that Log4j 1 had
reached end of life and that users of Log4j 1 are
recommended to upgrade to Apache Log4j 2.

If the log4j properties ot xml is not configured, only error and fatal logs will be logged.
Configuring properties is much more simpler than Configuring xml
save the properties as log4j2.properties instead of log4j.properties as the former is deprecated
the properties file can be built from scratch by using the springframework guru article
set the log level in properties to trace as it will log all the info
use appender.file.append=true to append logs instead of overwriting
if we want to turn off the logging, logger.file.level=off
priority -- properties>xml

Log4j can be setup in baseclass and called anywhere in the scripts using super
but log4j2 should be declared in each and every class' setup method, since it takes class name as parameter
and it prints classname in front of each and every log for better identification

Exception Handling
Exception - unexpected condition at runtime
Handling any unexpected behavior during execution
Catch the exception and log messages for troubleshooting
Enables continuation of runs even if a test fails

What is a properties file
Properties file is a file with .properties as extension
(e.g config.properties)
Is used in Java (and related technologies) to store
configurable parameters
Parameters as stored as key:value pairs (key=value)
example:
browser=firefox

How to create a properties file
Create a new file inside your java project and name it 
with .properties extension.
example config.properties

How to get data from properties file
Step 1
Create a object of class Properties class
Properties prop = new Properties();
Step 2
Create a object of class InputStream
InputStream input = new FileInputStream("location of
properties file");
Step 3
Load Properties file
prop.load(input);
Step 4
Get values from Properties file
prop.getProperty("browser");
How to set data to properties file
Step 1
Create a object of class Properties class
Properties prop = new Properties();
Step 2
Create a object of class OutputStream
OutputStream output = new FileOutputStream("location of
properties file");
Step 3
Set values
prop.setProperty("result", "pass");
Step 4
Store values in properties file
prop.store(output, "comments");
Helpful Tips
Use # or ! to put comments in properties file

To retrieve the locators of a webpage, we can use katalon extension from chrome webstore
It's like selenium IDE
It provides multiple locators for each and every webelement

What are Headless Browsers
Headless Browsers are web browsers without a head or GUI (Graphical User
Interface)
i.e. you cannot see anything on your screen, programs runs at backend.
Headless Browsers are software programs that access the web pages but do not
show them to the user.
Headless Chrome
Html Unit Browser
Zombie.js
PhantomJS
TrifleJS
SlimmerJS
Why should we use Headless Browsers
Headless Browsers can be used for :
Running your test on a headless systems like linux os without gui.
When you want simulate multiple browser behaviour on a single machine.
To use minimal resources (because there is no GUI)
Need to run your test just for data creation
When should we NOT use Headless Browsers
Headless Browsers should not/cannot be used:
If you need to visually observe your test on the browser
It does not give you exact feedback of what your customers will actually experience
on your website (Page loading speeds ...etc)
Headless Browsers sometimes may throw errors that is not observed on real
browsers
Examples of Headless Browsers
https://gist.github.com/evandrix/3694955
Helpful Tips
You can use actual browsers on a headless machine
Real browsers can run in headless manner on systems with Linux with zero
configurations. CI systems like Jenkins can be used.
Read about Xvfb - X virtual frame buffer
It is a display server that performs all graphical operations in memory without
showing anything on the screen.
Therefore it does not require the system to have a screen or gui.
HtmlUnit browser can be run with Web Driver and not with Selenium RC.
Selenium RC cannot support headless HtmlUnit browser.
