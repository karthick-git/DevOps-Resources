The list of dependencies required for creating a basic selenium java framework
Selenium Java
junit
geckodriver

create a folder inside the project called driver and place the drivers inside that
To add gecko driver exe
System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver",” path to gecko driver exe”);
OR
System.setProperty("webdriver.firefox.marionette", “path to gecko driver exe”);
If we are setting the driver path in environment variables --> path, we don't need to use System.setProperty in the code
after setting the path, open cmd and type ChromeDriver.exe and hit enter, the driver should start running successfully

How to add Chrome Driver
Run a test on Chrome browser
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver",”location of
chromedriver”);
Webdriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

helpful tips
Always check the latest version of chrome driver from https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver

How to add IE Driver
System.setProperty("webdriver.ie.driver",”location of iedriver”);
Webdriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();

If IE is throwing protected mode settings are not the same for all zones error, open IE-->Settings-->Security
uncheck Enable protected mode under all 4 icons-->apply & close

Use WebDriver Manager for Automatic management of browser drivers for Selenium
Uses : don't need to download drivers.exes for any browser
WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
WebDriverManager.firefoxdriver().setup();
WebDriverManager.operadriver().setup();
WebDriverManager.phantomjs().setup();
WebDriverManager.edgedriver().setup();
WebDriverManager.iedriver().setup();
