Prerequisites
Java is installed on the system
Eclipse is installed on the system
Maven is installed on the system

Create a Maven project in Eclipse
add dependencies in pom.xml
directly copy & paste the dependencies in pom.xml from maven repository -->Selenium java or go to the dependencies tab in pom.xml
and give the groupID, artifactID & version, it will get added in pom.xml
The list of dependencies required for creating a basic selenium java framework
Selenium Java
junit
geckodriver

create a folder inside the project called driver and place the drivers inside that
To add gecko driver exe
System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver",” path to gecko driver exe”);
OR
System.setProperty("webdriver.firefox.marionette", “path to gecko driver exe”);
If we are setting the driver path in environment variables --> path, we don't need to use System.setProperty in the code
after setting the path, open cmd and type ChromeDriver.exe and hit enter, the driver should start running successfully

How to add Chrome Driver
Run a test on Chrome browser
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver",”location of
chromedriver”);
Webdriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

helpful tips
Always check the latest version of chrome driver from https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver

How to add IE Driver
System.setProperty("webdriver.ie.driver",”location of iedriver”);
Webdriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();

helpful tips
Always check the latest version of ie driver from https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver
If IE is throwing protected mode settings are not the same for all zones error, open IE-->Settings-->Security
uncheck Enable protected mode under all 4 icons-->apply & close

Use WebDriver Manager for Automatic management of browser drivers for Selenium
Uses : don't need to download drivers.exes for any browser
WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
WebDriverManager.firefoxdriver().setup();
WebDriverManager.operadriver().setup();
WebDriverManager.phantomjs().setup();
WebDriverManager.edgedriver().setup();
WebDriverManager.iedriver().setup();
References
https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager

Use the below sample code
WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup(); or WebDriverManager.chromedriver().version("").setup();
Webdriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

helpful tips
Check your selected locator in different browsers
Can take help of tools for generating xpath and cssSelectors like chropath plugin or xmltoolbox.appspot.com
Can ask developers to provide unique ids to every web element for easy identification and location

Implement POM

A Design Principle where we Create separate Object Repository to store object locators
For each web page there should be a separate page class
The page class will have all object locators and preferably
action methods for the corresponding page

Step 1 :
Create a class for each web page
Step 2 :
Add object locators
Step 3 :
Create class for test
Step 4 :
Refer objects from page classes
Step 5 :
Run and validate

Benefits of POM
=============
Test Objects and Functions are separated for easy
maintenance and keeping the code clean
Objects are kept separated from test scripts and can be
used multiple times in multiple tests
Every unique object locator is created only once
Easy Maintenance and Less Rework

What is TestNG
TestNG is a testing framework for the Java programming
language created by Cédric Beust and inspired by JUnit
and NUnit.
Makes test creation, execution and reporting efficient
Uses annotations like
@BeforeTest, @AfterTest,
@BeforeSuite, @AfterSuite
@BeforeMethod, @AfterMethos
@BeforeClass, @AfterClass
NG = Next Generation

Install TestNG for selenium
help-->Install new software -->Add "https://dl.bintray.com/testng-team/testng-eclipse-release"
the above URL was taken from https://github.com/cbeust/testng-eclipse/
Select Next and finish

Add TestNG libraries
Configure build path --> add libraries --> testng--> finish
Or add maven dependency for TestNG from mvnrepository.com

Advantages of TestNG
Makes test creation, execution and reporting efficient
Helps in Grouping of tests
Helps in Prioritizing of tests
Parallel execution
Reporting

Creating TestNG.xml file
RC on the project --> TestNG --> Convert to TestNG
Use Include/Exclude methods in TestNg xml to Include and Exclude the methods in a class for running

Uses of TestNG.xml
include tests, class, packages etc
exclude tests, class, package etc
set test dependency
set test priorities
pass parameters to test methods
run in parallel

What is Extent Reports | How to use Extent Reports in
Selenium
What is Extent Report
HTML Reporting library
ExtentReports is an open-source reporting API for Java
and .NET. It creates an interactive HTML report of your
test session.
ExtentReports also has a commercial version (Pro)
How to implement ExtentReports in Selenium Java
Step 1 :
Add ExentReports libraries in project
You can add jars or maven dependency
Step 2 :
Create references of ExtentReport func
Step 3 :
Use ExtentReport functions
log, info, pass, fail etc
Step 4 :
Run and Validate

Maven dependency can be copied from ExtentReports.com
To see an example for implementing ExtentReports, go to documentation --> Java --> Examples

What is DesiredCapabilities
A class in Selenium library org.openqa.selenium.remote.DesiredCapabilities
Describes a series of key/value pairs
Used to set properties for browser like BrowserName, Platform, Version etc
