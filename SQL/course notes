Important points:
An SQL statement is terminated with a ;
not always,but it's a good idea to use it.
White spaces are ignored
It's a good practice to capitalize SQL queries
Single quotes are used for literal strings
double quotes are used for identifiers with a space in it, while setting aliases
If te aliases don't contain a space,then double quotes are not required
AS keyword is optional, but it's a good practice to use it
FROM needs to be first in the query, followed by where, order by. Limit and offset at the last
There order of column names in the query will determine the order of columns in the reult table
Good practice to have values in the insert query in a new line
Deleted rows can't be recovered
Before doing DELETE FROM, do SELECT FROM and see the results, if you get the expected result, change SELECT to DELETE
NULL isn't a value, it's a state of lack/absence of value, so it can't be used in where filter like where value = NULL.
The above statement will show no results, instead try "where value is null";
you can't have 2 tables with the same name in a DB
In standard SQL, Single quotes is used for string literal, in MySQL double quotes is used

SQL Fundamentals
FROM clause is used to point a particular table
WHERE clause is used to select particular rows
SELECT statement is used to return values from DB
INSERT statement is used to add a row to a table
UPDATE statement is used to change data in a row
DELETE statement is used to remove a row from a table
AS is used to set alias to a column name
ORDER BY is used to retieve table data with a particular column name in alphabetical order
AND is used to combine two filters

DB organization
DB has tables --> tables have rows and columns
Row is like an individual record
column is like a field
Each row in a table has a unique key, which helps in identifying the row
Sometimes the unique key is hidden, but a table must have one
When a column is used as a unique key, it;s called the primary key
Tables are related by keys
If a column refers to keys of another table, it's called a foreign key

SQL Queries:
To retrieve the entire table data: SELECT * FROM <TABLENAME>
To retieve table data with a particular column name in alphabetical/ascending order: SELECT * FROM countries ORDER BY region_id;
To retieve particular columns from a table: SELECT country_name,region_id FROM countries;
To set aliases for a particular column: SELECT country_name,region_id AS "RID" FROM countries;
To filter certail rows: SELECT * FROM countries WHERE region_id=2;
To limit the reults to certain records: SELECT * FROM countries WHERE region_id=2 LIMIT 3;
To retrieve certain number of records from certain number of rows: SELECT * FROM countries WHERE region_id=2 LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2;
To retrieve the number of records in a table: SELECT COUNT(* )FROM countries;
To retrieve the number of records in a particular column: SELECT COUNT(region_id)FROM countries;
For the above command, the results may vary according to the number of cells that have no data
To insert a new row in the table: INSERT INTO countries(country_id,country_name,region_id) VALUES('IC','Iceland',1);
To execute a particular query, select that and run or place the cursor at the line of the query and run
To update data of a columns in a particular row: UPDATE countries SET country_id='IR',region_id=2 WHERE country_name='Ireland';
Another example: UPDATE countries SET country_name='Greenland',region_id=3,country_id='GL' WHERE country_name='Mexico';
To delete a particular row: DELETE FROM countries WHERE country_id='IR';
To create a new table: CREATE TABLE toss (a INTEGER, b TEXT);
To insert values into that new table: INSERT INTO toss VALUES(2,'TAIL');
To delete a table from DB: DROP TABLE toss;
To delete a table from DB and If unsure whether the table exists anymore: DROP TABLE IF EXISTS toss;
The above statement doesn't return any error either way
To insert a row full of null values: INSERT INTO toss DEFAULT VALUES;
To insert data from a different table into the current table: INSERT INTO toss(a,b) SELECT country_id,country_name FROM countries;
To create a table with a NOT NULL constraint: CREATE TABLE toss1 (a INTEGER NOT NULL, b TEXT NOT NULL, c TEXT);
To add default values to columns for which we didn't provide data during insert:
CREATE TABLE toss(a TEXT,B TEXT, C TEXT DEFAULT 'abc');
INSERT INTO toss(a,b) VALUES ('a','b');
The select on toss table will give the result --> a,b,abc now
Note: If needed we can overwrite the default value with our value
To add a unique contraint to a column: CREATE TABLE toss(a TEXT UNIQUE,B TEXT);
Note: Null state is exempt from unique contraint (in RDBMS)
To use UNIQUE and NOT NULL together:  CREATE TABLE toss(a TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,B TEXT);
To modify an already created table: ALTER TABLE toss ADD d TEXT;
Note: contraints can be used while entering data in the new colummns, if needed
TO create a primary key like ID, which is autogenerated (In RDBMS): CREATE TABLE toss(a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,B TEXT, C TEXT DEFAULT 'abc');
The above statement will enforce Not null and unique contraint for column 'a' automatically
A table can have only one ID column
To add more than one filters: use OR,AND,LIKE,IN
To filter with value containing wildcard: SELECT country_id,country_name FROM countries WHERE country_id LIKE '%A%' ORDER BY country_id;
To match second character: SELECT country_id,country_name FROM countries WHERE country_id LIKE '_A%' ORDER BY country_id;
To match results from a list: SELECT country_id,country_name FROM countries WHERE country_id IN ('CA','GL','NL');
To know the different values present in a column without duplication: SELECT DISTINCT region_id from countries;
Distinct can also be used like Distinct a,b. It will give unique a values and corresponding b values
Order by has different types: 
ORDER BY name - ASCII order
ORDER BY name ASC - ascending order (same as ASCII)
ORDER BY name DESC - descending order
ORDER BY can take more than 1 column name as parameter

Below code checks if a or b is 0, if 0 then it prints false, otherwise true
SELECT
    CASE WHEN a THEN 'true' ELSE 'false' END as boolA,
    CASE WHEN b THEN 'true' ELSE 'false' END as boolB
    FROM boolset;
    
Below code checks if a or b is equal to the value mentioned after when, if equal then it prints false, otherwise true
SELECT
    CASE a WHEN 11 THEN 'true' ELSE 'false' END as boolA,
    CASE b WHEN 14 THEN 'true' ELSE 'false' END as boolB
    FROM boolset;

Inner Join:
Like intersection in a set
SELECT departments.location_id AS LEFT,locations.location_id AS RIGHT
    FROM departments JOIN locations ON departments.location_id=locations.location_id

Left Outer join/ simply outer join:
Gives all of the left table plus the intersection part
SELECT departments.location_id AS LEFT,locations.location_id AS RIGHT
    FROM departments LEFT JOIN locations ON departments.location_id=locations.location_id;

Roght Outer join:
Not explicitly supported by most of the DBMS
Gives all of the right table plus the intersection part
Can be achieved by interchanging the left and right tables
SELECT locations.location_id AS LEFT,departments.location_id AS RIGHT
    FROM locations LEFT JOIN departments ON locations.location_id=departments.location_id;

When different tables have same column names, we have to use aliases.
A junction table is one where many to many relationship is implemented. 
It will contain ID columns of different tables. Eg: ID, Customer_id, item_id

Near the select statement we mention the aliases of columns having same names,
and near from and join keywords, we mention the aliases of the tables
So the above query would look like
SELECT d.location_id AS LEFT,l.location_id AS RIGHT
    FROM departments as d LEFT JOIN locations as l ON d.location_id=l.location_id;
   
To use a string which already has a ' in it, eg: here's, then use two single quotes like 'here''s'
To concatenate in standard SQL, postgreSQL etc. use ||
E.g: 'this' || '&' || 'that'
In MySQL, it uses a function called concat
eg: SELECT CONCAT ('This','&','That');
MSSQL uses + eg: 'This'+'&'+'That'

Standard String functions:
SUBSTR(string,start,length);
LENGTH(string);
TRIM(string);
UPPER(string);
LOWER(string);

To display the countries by desc order of their length: SELECT country_name, length(country_name) as len FROM countries ORDER BY len DESC;
To substring a string: SELECT substr('this string',6); Result: string--> count starts from 1
To substring a string upto certain chars: SELECT substr('this string',6,3); Result: str--> upto 3 chars
Usage: Used in seperating day,month,year of a date
SELECT start_date,
    substr(start_date,1,4),
    substr(start_date,6,2),
    substr(start_date,9,2)
    FROM job_history ORDER BY start_date DESC
;


To trim the unwanted spaces:SELECT trim('      string   ');
Trim supports LTRIM,RTRIM,TRIM a char (eg: SELECT TRIM('&&&STRING&&&','&'))
Usage: In trimming unwanted spaces in user's inputs

To covert lower into uppercase and viz.,
SELECT 'string'='STRING'; will return 0 as they are not equal
SELECT upper('string')='STRING'; will return 1

Numeric types in SQLite:
INTEGER and REAL
INTEGER type is provided in 3 precisions:INTEGER,DECIMAl,MONEY
REAL type is provided in 2 precisions:REAL,FLOAT
(.1+.2)*10!=1.0+2.0 --> Very important. When compared, the result will be false
Because, real nummers sacrifice accuracy for scale

To know the type of result: 
SELECT typeof(1+1); - INTEGER
SELECT typeof(1+1.0); - REAL
SELECT typeof('ash'); - TEXT
SELECT typeof('My name is'+'ash'); - INTEGER
The above statement results in INTEGER, because as soon as it sees the + sign, it will try to convert the values to INTEGER
It fails and results in 0 and then just concatenates

Division:
Append SELECT in front of all the below statements
1/2 = 0
1.0/2= 0.5
CAST(1 AS REAL)/2=0.5
17/5=3
17/5,17%5= 3 2

Round:
Rounds off a value to certain decimal points
ROUND(2.55555)=3
ROUND(2.55555,3)=2.556
ROUND(2.55555,0)=3

Date:
Standard SQL format for date: 2019-05-17 15:23:56
Dates and times are generally stored as UTC
SELECT datetime('now'); - displays GMT date and time (-5:30)
SELECT date('now');
SELECT time('now');
SELECT datetime('now','+1 day');
SELECT datetime('now','+5 days');
SELECT datetime('now','-1 month');
SELECT datetime('now','-1 year');
SELECT datetime('now','+3 hours','+24 minutes','-1 day','+3 years');

Aggregate data is receiving data from more than 1 row at a time
