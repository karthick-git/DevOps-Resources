Calculate duration with formula - start date - end date

Open tableau public and go to more option in connect section and choose google sheets and authorize your mail ID

Once the data source is open in tableau, click on Sheet 1 in the bottom (duration calculation can also be done in tableau)
Drop Education/Experience in rows and start date in columns
Click on start date in columns tab and change it to months(2nd) and change it from discrete to continuous
Drag and drop duration in Size
Click on Education/Experience in rows and sort it by fields --> End date (descending) and maximum aggregation
Drag and Drop start date and end date to labels and change it to months(2nd) and continuous
Click on Start date and end date in dimensions section and click on default properties --> date format --> custom --> mmm yy

Click on Marks and Add a new field --> today and make it continuous
RC on month of start date in graph and select add ref line
value --> month (today)
scope --> per pane
label --> value & click ok
RC on Axis and change the title Month of start date to Date
Rename sheet1 to timeline

Create a new sheet and add Institution/Company in columns and sort by Manual and Drag and Drop according to chronological order
Marks --> Shapes --> Select whatever shape you need
we can also download any shape(e.g. resmed shape)  & save it to my tableau repository --> shapes
Drag and drop Institution/Company in dimensions to shapes in marks
click on shapes in marks to assign a logo
to increase the size of the logos, click on size under marks and increase the size
Rename the sheet to Institution/Company
Hide the header by clicking on the company name and hide field label for columns

Create a seperate sheet in Google sheets and add the tools information
Input all the data (Education/Experience column should act as the foreign key for inner join btw sheet1 & 2)
refresh the data source
create an inner join
create a new sheet in tableau
add tools in columns
select shapes in marks
assign logos and hide fields
Tools--> unclick tool header to hide the name of the tool

To create speedometer gauge
Create a new sheet in tableau
Dimensions --> calculated field -> name it proficiency % (formula : AVG([Proficiency])/WINDOW_MAX(AVG([Proficiency])))
Dimensions --> calculated field -> name it Angle (formula: INT([Proficiency%] * 180))
Similarly create the below calculated fields
X = 1 + SQRT(2) * COS(1-[Proficiency%])*180 * PI() / 180
Y = 1 + SQRT(2) * SIN([Angle] * PI() / 180)

Dimensions-->Create parameter
Name:Select a tool to know the proficiency
Data type:String
Allowable values:List
Add from field:Tools
Save

Edit X and Y to new formulae and rename the fields as X with and Y with parameter
X with parameter = 
IIF(ATTR([Tools])=[Select a Tool to know proficiency],
1 + SQRT(2) * COS((1-[Proficiency%])*180 * PI() / 180),1)

Y with parameter = 
IIF(ATTR([Tools])=[Select a Tool to know proficiency],
1 + SQRT(2) * SIN([Angle] * PI() / 180),1)


Map X with parameter on columns and Y with parameter on rows
Drag and drop tools to details
X & Y parameters --> compute using --> tools
Select line instead of circle in Marks
Download a speedometer image
Map-->Background Images--> Interactive resume--> select image
Left -0.5
Right 2.5
Top   1
Bottom 2.5

Click on X with perimeter axis --> Edit axis--> 
Range - fixed
fixed start -0.5
fixed end 2.5
Click on Y with perimeter axis --> Edit axis--> 
Range - fixed
fixed start 1
fixed end 2.5

RC on the parameter -> show parameter control
Drag and drop another Y with parameter in rows
Click on second Y with parameter and select dual axis
uncheck show header in X & Y axis
Remove measure names with colors from marks from both 1st and 2nd Y with parameter
second Y with parameter--> compute using Tools
RC on Y axis and select synchromize axis
Bring tools to labels on 2nd Y with parameter
Bring proficiency to labels on 2nd Y with parameter (not proficiency%)
measure with average and format --> Number --> Number(Standard)
Bring proficiency% to labels on 2nd Y with parameter and format -->Number--> percentage (not needed)
Change line to shapes in marks for Y with parameter 2nd
and drag and drop tools to shapes
Labels-->Text-->Tool name = <Tools>
Proficiency% = <AGG(Proficiency%)>
Proficiency = <AVG(Proficiency)>
label-->alignment-->top
If a tool has proficiency as 10, half of the image will be hidden, to fix that
click on 1st Y with parameter on rows-->Show header
Click on Y header-->edit axis-->give fixed start as 0.9 instead of 1
again hide heaader
To get rid of the dotted lines on the chart, RC anywhere on the graph-->Format--> Lines(5th icon)--> Zero lines--> None

To create responsibilites--> Create a new sheet named responsibilites in google sheets and enter the responsibilites

Refresh the data and go to Data source tab and drag and drop responsibilites sheet below tools sheet and create an union
Create a sheet in tableau and name it responsibilites
Drag and drop responsibilitesin rows
adjust it's row height and column width

To create a geographic location map
Click on location-->geographic role-->city
Drag & drop longitude to column and latitude to row
drag location to label
If tableau is not able to detect the location-->Edit location and change the country
If that's also not working, then change the latitude and longitude manually
