Step01-SpringBootGoalsAndImportantFeatures:

Goals of Spring Boot:
Enable building production ready app quickly
-Instead of building one big monolith application, build many smaller microservices

provide common nonfunctional features
-embedded servers
-metrics
-health checks
-externalized config

what spring Boot is not:
ZERO code generation
neither an app server nor a web server -it provides great integration with embedded servers like tomcat, jetty etc.

Features:
quick starter projects with auto config
-web
-JPA
If we are building a web app, we need spring mvc, spring core, validation framework, logging framework. In addition to that we need to configure everything needed.
For eg. dispatcher servlet, view resolvers etc.
But with spring boot starter web we get spring mvc, spring core, validation framework, logging framework all these as a package
Similarly with spring boot starter JPA, we get default implementation of JPA, Hibernate, ORM
So we don't need to worry about framework, we can directly start with building entities
-embedded servers (tomcat,jetty,undertow)
If we are planning to deploy our application in to a linux server, in olden days we have to install linux-->Java-->Tomcat-->deploy app war
But in Spring Boot we can package the tomcat server with the app jar. So if I have java installed on linux, I can directly run my app, I don't need to install tomcat seperately.
production ready features
-mertrics and health checks
-externalized config
Spring boot provides monitoring for our app through spring boot actuators.
we can find out how many times a service was called, how many times a service failed,service is up and running or not
Config can be different for different envs. SO just creating a simple property in property file will do the job for us
Also provides support for different profiles


Step02-DevelopingSpringApplicationsBeforeSpringBoot:

In Spring MVC, 
we have to decide which dependencies to use and which versions of them to use
Jackson databind - to do data binding and validation
Log4j - for logging
default exception has to be implemented
complete spring config file has to be created
view resolver - to redirect the views to JSP
message source - to implement internationalization
complete web.xml file has to be created
dispatcher servlet - to handle all the requests and act as a front controller
spring security filter checks - to intercept all the requests

Step04-CreatingASimpleRESTController
Tomcat runs on port 8080 by default
@RestController -serves rest requests
Whenever creating a bean, add constructor, toString, Getters & Setters as required
@GetMapping - to map a GET request

Step05-WhatIsSpringBootAutoConfiguration?
@SpringBootApplication - denotes that it's a spring context file and it enables auto config and it enables component scan
component scan - it would start scanning classes in the same package and subpackages for any beans, so class with @RestController will be registered as a component
SpringApplication.run - used to run the spring context and also returns app context
How is auto config happening?
As a part of Spring Boot framework, we have spring boot auto config in dependencies-->spring boot auto config-->autoconfig.web.servlet-->DispatcherServletAutoConfiguration.class
Spring Boot basically looks at 2 things
1.  framework available on class path
2.existing beans configured for the application
based on these spring boot provides basic config needed to configure the application with these framework
In app.property logging.level.org.springframework = DEBUG would start the app in debug mode will provide a debug mode report

Step06-SpringBootvsSpringvsSpringMVC
What's the core problem that Spring MVC solves?
Most important feature of Spring Framework is Dependency Injection. At the core of all Spring Modules is Dependency Injection or IOC Inversion of Control.
